# python-kivy-healthapp

this app will not run as there are no .h5 files in this repo, du to github limitation so you need to add them by your own
* eyed.h5
* skin_dis_1.h5

add this two file after downloading or cloning

then : 

1) python -m venv env
2) source env/bin/activate
3) pip install -r requirements.txt
4) python main.py

voila!!!
